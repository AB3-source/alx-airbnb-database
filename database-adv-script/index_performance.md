# Index Performance Report ‚Äì Airbnb Clone Database

This document evaluates how SQL indexes improve the performance of queries in the project.

## üîç 1. Before Indexing (Baseline)

### Query Tested
Total bookings per user:

```sql
SELECT 
    users.id, users.name, COUNT(bookings.id)
FROM 
    users
LEFT JOIN 
    bookings ON users.id = bookings.user_id
GROUP BY 
    users.id;
EXPLAIN Output (Before Index)
	‚Ä¢	Full table scan on bookings
	‚Ä¢	JOIN between users and bookings not using an index
	‚Ä¢	High rows examined

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Indexing Strategy

Indexes Created
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_property_id ON reviews(property_id);

3. After Indexing (Improved Performance)

EXPLAIN Output (After Index)
	‚Ä¢	JOIN between users and bookings uses idx_bookings_user_id
	‚Ä¢	Faster lookup of bookings related to each user
	‚Ä¢	Reduced rows examined (from full table scan to index scan)
